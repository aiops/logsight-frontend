      Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. If your habitual residence is in the EU, and
      you are a consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to you by
      obligatory provisions of the law of your country of residence. logsight.ai and
      yourself both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
      Berlin, which means that you may make a claim to defend your consumer
      protection rights in regards to these Conditions of Use in Germany, or in the EU
      country in which you reside.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Neither party may transfer or assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, except for in the case of a merger, reorganization, or acquisition of substantially all assets of the applicable party. Any purported assignment contrary to this section shall be void. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes any previous agreements or representations, either oral or written with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. All amendments may be made only in writing. All notices shall be in writing and delivered either personally, or by registered mail or courier, to the address and contact of the parties or by email, as set forth in the Purchase Order. Any such notice shall be deemed given five business days after being placed in the mail, or one business day after personal delivery or email. Any failure by a party to insist upon or enforce performance by the other of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or remedies under this Agreement or otherwise by law will not be construed as a waiver of such right.
      <br>
      <br>
      * These terms and conditions will not be applicable in any case where customer fails to pay or breaches the service agreement for a period of over 90 days and has received two notifications from logsight.ai.

      <br>
      <br>

      <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">Binding Arbitration</p>
      <br>
      Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to this contract shall
      be determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in accordance with the
      Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of Arbitration being part of the
      European Centre of Arbitration having its seat in Strasbourg, and which are in
      force at the time the application for arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this
      clause constitutes acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be Berlin, Germany.
      The language of the proceedings shall be German. Applicable rules of substantive
      law shall be the law of Germany.
      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">Restrictions</p>
      <br>
      The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the
      Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be
      joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute
      to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and
      (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
      representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">Exceptions to Arbitration</p>
      <br>
      The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above
      provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or
      protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a
      Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
      invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If
      this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
      arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal
      or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
      jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to
      submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

      <h2>Indemnification</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless, including our subsidiaries,
      affiliates, and all of our respective officers, agents, partners, and employees, from
      and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable
      attorneys’ fees and expenses, made by any third party due to or arising out of: (1)
      use of the Site; (2) breach of these Terms of Use; (3) any breach of your
      representations and warranties set forth in these Terms of Use; (4) your violation
      of the rights of a third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights;
      or (5) any overt harmful act toward any other user of the Site with whom you
      connected via the Site. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right, at
      your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for
      which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate, at your
      expense, with our defense of such claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify
      you of any such claim, action, or proceeding which is subject to this
      indemnification upon becoming aware of it.
      <br>
      <br>

      We will maintain certain data that you transmit to the Site for the purpose of
      managing the performance of the Site, as well as data relating to your use of the
      Site. Although we perform regular routine backups of data, you are solely
      responsible for all data that you transmit or that relates to any activity you have
      undertaken using the Site. You agree that we shall have no liability to you for any

      <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

      These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site
      or in respect to the Site constitute the entire agreement and understanding
      between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
      these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These
      Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any
      or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be
      responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any
      cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of
      these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
      provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use
      and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
      There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created
      between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the Site. You
      agree that these Terms of Use will not be construed against us by virtue of having
